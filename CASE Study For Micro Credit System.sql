Case Study:: Developing a Micro Credit System Server Using SQL

In the financial services sector, micro credit systems play a critical role in empowering individuals and small 
businesses by providing small loans with minimal bureaucracy. This case study describes the development of a 
comprehensive SQL Server-based database for a Micro Credit System. The goal was to build a secure, scalable, and 
efficient backend to manage borrowers, loans, payments, agents, and repayment schedules.

Objectives::

The primary objectives of this project were to:

Design a normalized database schema for handling microcredit data efficiently.

Create stored procedures to manage CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for key entities like loans and 
repayments.

Implement functions for quick access to important metrics, such as remaining loan balance or overdue amounts.

Maintain data integrity through relationships, constraints, and transaction management.

Utilize advanced SQL Server features like CASE, ISNULL, IF EXISTS, aggregate functions, and pagination for 
effective data operations.

Database Design::

The database schema was designed to include the core entities involved in a micro credit platform:

Customers: Information about loan recipients.

Employees: Field agents who manage loans and collections.

Loans: Loan records including amount, interest rate, duration, and disbursement details.

Payments: Payments made by customers against loans.

Accounts: Bank-like accounts for each customer.

Transactions: All transaction records such as deposits and withdrawals.

Branches: Locations where the employees work.

LoanTypes: Defines various loan categories offered.

Guarantors: Individuals who guarantee the repayment of a customer,s loan.

Each table was defined with appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign key
constraints to ensure data integrity and efficient query performance.


Implementation::

1. Creating Tables and Relationships:

All tables were created with clear relationships:

Each Loan is linked to a Borrower and an Agent.

Each Repayment is linked to a Loan.

LoanSchedule is generated based on loan terms and helps track due and paid amounts.


2. Inserting Initial Data:

Initial records were added to simulate real-world data such as:

A few borrowers with their profiles.

Loans issued to them with respective agents.

Scheduled and completed repayment entries.


3. Developing Stored Procedures:

In the Micro Credit System, the GetCustomerFullDetails stored procedure was developed to 
retrieve a customer's complete financial profile using their name. It returns:
Loan ID and amount
Loan type
Account details (ID, type, balance)
Guarantor name
The procedure uses LEFT JOIN to combine data from the Customers, Loans, LoanTypes, Accounts, and Guarantors tables.
This ensures that even if some data is missing (e.g., no loan), the customer's basic profile still appears.


4. Creating Functions:

To support data retrieval in the Micro Credit System, the following functions were created:

1. getaccountbalance(@AccountID)
A scalar function that returns the balance of a given account.

2. gettransactionsbytype(@type)
A table-valued function that returns all transactions for accounts of a specific type.

3. getguarantorinfo(@customerId)
A multi-statement table-valued function that returns the guarantor’s name, phone, and relation for a given customer.

5. Advanced SQL Queries:

Advanced queries included:

CASE logic to calculate penalties for overdue payments.

ISNULL used to handle NULL values in optional fields.

IF EXISTS to check for duplicate loans or repayments before insert.

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) to compute branch-wise performance.

Pagination using OFFSET-FETCH for scalable data loading.

Key Features and Benefits::

Normalized Schema

Reduced redundancy and improved data consistency.

Made the system easier to extend for savings modules or insurance later.

Stored Procedures::

Centralized business logic for repetitive operations like loan disbursement or repayment entry.

Functions::

Delivered real-time loan insights and summaries to dashboards and mobile apps.

Advanced Queries:

Enabled custom reports like overdue borrowers list, agent performance, and branch summaries.

Challenges and Solutions:

Data Integrity

Solved using foreign key constraints and BEGIN TRANSACTION blocks in stored procedures.

Performance Optimization

Created indexes on LoanDate, BorrowerID, and AgentID.

Used temp tables and CTEs for complex aggregation
Designed schema with modularity, so new modules (e.g., group loans, savings accounts) can be added.

Conclusion::

The SQL Server-based Micro Credit System successfully met its design goals. With a normalized schema, robust
stored procedures, reusable functions, and efficient queries, the system forms a strong and scalable backend. 
It supports the essential operations of a microfinance organization while allowing room for future growth and expansion.
